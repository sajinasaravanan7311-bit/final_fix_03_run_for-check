Recovery Plan Scorer

Scores recovery plans based on simulated outcomes.

Scoring happens AFTER simulation, not before. A plan's composite score
is NOT the sum of individual recommendation scores (which would double-count
overlapping effects and miss interaction effects). Instead, we run the
actual simulation and read the real resulting state.

Composite score formula (deterministic, no ML):
    0.45 * deadline_probability
    + 0.30 * delay_recovered_fraction
    + 0.15 * (1 - normalized_risk_score)
    - 0.10 * normalized_execution_complexity

The complexity penalty is critical: it stops the system from always
recommending the most aggressive plan. A 7-action plan needs to lose
points relative to a 3-action plan with similar probability, because
the 3-action plan is more likely to actually get executed correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
P0 FIX (see recovery-plan audit): delay term is now BASELINE-RELATIVE,
not normalized against a fixed 30-day constant.

Previously: normalized_delay = min(expected_delay_days / 30.0, 1.0).
For any project whose baseline delay is already >= 30 days (common for
a genuinely at-risk project -- e.g. 34.5 days in the reference case),
normalized_delay saturates to 1.0 for EVERY plan, including the
do-nothing baseline itself. That makes the delay term contribute
~0 regardless of how much delay a plan actually recovers, while the
complexity penalty keeps scaling with action count. Net effect: a
0-action "plan" that changes nothing can outscore a 7-action plan that
recovers 5.8 real days, purely because the 0-action plan pays no
complexity tax and the delay signal was invisible to begin with.

Fix: delay_recovered_fraction = (baseline_delay_days - expected_delay_days) / baseline_delay_days,
clamped to [0, 1]. This directly measures what fraction of the CURRENT
project's own delay this plan recovers, so it can never saturate to
the same value for every plan regardless of baseline size, and a
0-action plan always scores exactly 0 on this term (since it recovers
0 days of ITS OWN baseline) rather than tying with everyone else.
