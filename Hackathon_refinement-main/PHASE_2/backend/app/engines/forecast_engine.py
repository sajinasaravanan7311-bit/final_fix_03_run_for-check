        FIX (was `_status_derived_elapsed_days` below): the previous
        implementation inferred elapsed time purely from sprint status
        labels -- `completed_sprints * sprint_days` plus the in-progress
        sprint's window capped at exactly one sprint length. That meant:
          - an "In Progress" sprint running weeks past its planned end date
            was still only ever credited with one sprint-length of elapsed
            time -- the overrun vanished.
          - a "Not Started" sprint whose planned start date had already
            passed contributed ZERO elapsed days, no matter how overdue it
            was, because the function never looked at what today's date
            actually is.
        A project stalled mid-sprint (exactly this project's Sprint 6/7/8
        situation) therefore showed almost no schedule delay, because the
        model's internal clock only advanced when a sprint's status field
        changed -- not when actual calendar time passed. Anchoring to the
        real current date fixes this unconditionally: a stalled sprint or a
        late-starting one now shows up as delay immediately, with no
        dependency on anyone updating a status dropdown.
