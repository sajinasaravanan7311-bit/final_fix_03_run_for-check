Monte Carlo Simulation Engine (Phase 3.2)

Performs probabilistic forecasting using Monte Carlo simulation.
Generates distribution of finish dates based on velocity and work variability.

Key principle: Target End Date is NEVER modified.
The target_end_date is a fixed business commitment used only for probability calculation.
All simulations hold target_end_date constant and generate variable finish_date outcomes.

        ended 2026-07-13 but is still marked In Progress with zero velocity —
        the old method credited only 14 days for Sprint 6 regardless of the
        actual overrun, making the project appear 11+ days younger than it is
        and producing an "ahead of schedule" result despite blockers,
        overloads, and zero throughput.

        Anchoring to the real date fixes this unconditionally: stalled sprints
        and overdue-but-not-started sprints immediately show up as elapsed
        schedule time, with no dependency on anyone updating a status field.

        Must stay in sync with ForecastEngine._calculate_schedule_elapsed_days,
        which uses the identical approach. If these two diverge, the
        deterministic and probabilistic elapsed-day figures will disagree and
        produce contradictory delay/probability signals.
