"""
test_workbook_parser_resource_fields.py

Batch B.1 regression coverage for two confirmed parser-level findings:

1. "Skill 3" (a genuine third skill column in the Team sheet, alongside
   "Skill 1"/"Skill 2") was not parsed at all, so a resource whose only
   matching skill is Skill 3 was invisible to ResourceIntelligence /
   covers_skill() feasibility checks. FIXED in workbook_parser.py.

2. Explicit `0` allocation/availability must survive parsing as 0.0, not be
   silently replaced by a default. This was ALREADY correct
   (`_average_pct_columns` uses `value is not None`, not `if value:`) --
   this test locks that behavior in as a regression guard.

Both tests build a minimal but complete in-memory workbook (all
REQUIRED_SHEETS, correct Row1/Row2/Row3+ layout) and drive the real
WorkbookParser end-to-end, rather than calling private parser methods
directly -- this is the actual "Workbook row -> parser -> Resource ->
ResourceIntelligence -> covers_skill()" path asked for.
